# Telemetry: Embedded Runtime Monitoring and Tuning

Telemetry is another means of testing your firmware. Unit test are
useful for testing your code's logic and making sure the behavior of
your code operates as intended. A debugger allows you step through your
code one line at a time, inspecting variables to see when adverse
behavior arises in your firmware. Telemetry, more or less, is a means of
feeding back information to the user about the current state of the
firmware during runtime.
